Play Connect Four

Board contents:

6 rows gives equal chances to both players
7 columns across gives an uneven number, so one person can win

42 total squares on the board with 3 outcomes for each square; player1, player2, or null

Rules:
Players will play in turn succession and the first player to connect four in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.

Logic:
There are 3 outcomes for each square, and three possibilities for each color to win.
